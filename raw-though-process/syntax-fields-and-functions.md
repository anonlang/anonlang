Being able to differential between code that should be ran once or multiple times is useful.

Languages have different ways they call functions/methods/lamdas
- Via keyword: fun, func, function, def
- Use parentheses
- Use parentheses and braces

For Anonlang, we'll try to keep it at basic English words to possibly avoid having to learn a new concept and to allow most people to recognize differences in fields and functions with no prior knowledge of coding.

Current considerations:
- Everything is lazy-loaded
- `define` keyword for 'constant' fields (or 'functions') that only get processed once
  - maybe keyword `set`?
- `action` keyword for code that does stuff each time it is called
  - maybe no keyword?
