# Raw Notes #
Everything in this directory is still a work-in-progress. Nothing is finalized.

As things are thought through, they may eventually be moved into the final documentation and library. When things are moved there, there should be a post explaining why and the tradeoffs/perspectives and research into other languages is good, but maybe don't need to be explicitly mentioned because ideas for Anonlang and Art should NOT be based off of other languages. No biases. Feel free to comment.

Many ideas here should be stretch goals and under the paradigm assumption that speed and size don't need to be a consideration. Imagine a programming language being built fifty years from now. The biggest benefit may be developer/user productivity, we don't need to worry too much about difficulty of implementation. Things can be written here as they would appear in future documentation.



## Anonlang vs Art Programming Language
First of all, I just thought there had to eventually be a better name that 'Anonlang'. And, I was originally thinking that everything from Anonlang would just be dumped into Art, but that doesn't seem to be the case. They will be different entities going forward, though the most similar of programming languages.

When there's an arbtrary-ish decision (not many), Anonlang will take the perspective of what's easier for computers (and to implment), and Art will take the role of what could be eventually better (more readable/maintainable) for end-users/devs.

For example, at this time, a difference might be that Anonlang uses brackets to define scopes and Art uses 'tabs' to define scope. Both methods take two tokens for a parser to recognize the scope/block/closure.
