# Anonlang #

The top priority for this language is developer productivity, and more specifically, quickly getting ideas to implementations and running. Another top focus is typing speed, comfort, and flow, more about that later.

Developers should prefer using the high-level abstractions, but the low-levels are fully accessible if needed.

Some describe Anonlang as having the power of Lisp with readability elegance of Ruby.

## Sample Code for an App ##

    config [
      name 'My Minimal App'
    ]
    alias root layout [
      text 'Hello, World!'
    ]
    create-window root



## Top Reasons To Use Anonlang ##

### A joy to program in ###
Typing confort is a huge part of Anonlang. There is a minimal need of using the shift-key in the core language. To define blocks/scopes, the square brackets are used instead of parenthesis or curly braces. This makes sense considering how much they are used in every program. Similar decision have been made, where the more often used features are easier to type than lesser used features.

### Quick to learn and get started ###
There are just a few general rules to the language. Also, it's just a small download to run Anonlang programs directly on your computer.



## Background ##
This is a 10-year project to learn and re-think and re-implement programming. All assumptions will be questioned without bias.

Some ideas about possible generalized axioms:

- Everything has an input and output.
