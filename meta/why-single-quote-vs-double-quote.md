# Single Quote vs Double Quote #

When dealing with 'strings' or 'text', the single quote key is easier to type than the double quote key.

The time where using a double quote may be favorable is when the text contains a single-quote-apostrophe. When wrapped with double-quotes the apostrophe doesn't need to be escaped, whereas text wrapped in single-quotes would need to escape the apostrophe.

Though, the same reasoning can be applied to instances where there is a quote within the text.

Considering that typing text in apps is much more common than apostrophes and quotes, the easiest meaningful character for signifying text in an code would be the single-quote. Thus, the common case is simplified.

To avoid needing the use of escaping apostrophes, the 'text-scope' can be used. Ex: `['isn't is not']` (Another page talks about text-scope vs double-quote.)
